EA-GML-ClassMapping
===================

An Enterprise Architect XML configuration for mapping ISO/OGC UML types to their XML Schema. See http://www.sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/10/domain_based_models/uml_profile_for_gml.html for documentation. These mappings are pretty standard and can be shared, hence this repository. Feel free to add mappings.
